A data analysis project built with Python, Pandas and Matplotlib.

The goal of this project is to explore datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and extract business insights.

The first dataset analyzed is the Netflix Titles dataset.

## 🚧 In progress

## STEP BY STEP

## Sprint 1-Data Exploration
- Dataset loading with Pandas
- Dataset inspection
- Missing values analysis
- Descriptive statistics

## Sprint 2- Exploratory data analysy (EDA)
Business Question Answered: 
- Does Netflix offer more movies or TV shows?
- Which countries contribute the most content?
- How has Netflix content evolved over time?
- Which content ratings are the most common?

### Key Insights

- Movies dominate the Netflix catalog.
- The United States overwhelmingly dominates the dataset.
- Netflix content production peaked around 2018.
- Most Netflix titles are rated TV-MA, suggesting a focus on mature audiences.

## Sprint 3 - Data Cleaning

- Missing values handling
- Missing categorical values replaced with "Unknown"
- Rows with missing critical values removed
- Duplicate detection and removal
- Clean dataset exported for future analyses

## Sprint 4 - Adavanced Analysis with Groupby
- Learn how to group data using `groupby()`
- Perform statistical aggregations on grouped data
- Compare Movies and TV Shows using multiple metrics
- Extract business insights from aggregated data

| `groupby()` | Grouping | Groups the dataset according to one or more variables |
| `mean()` | Aggregation | Computes the average value for each group |
| `count()` | Aggregation | Counts observations for each group |
| `agg()` | Multiple Aggregation | Computes multiple statistics simultaneously |
| `sort_values()` | Sorting | Sorts results by value |
| `head()` | Selection | Displays the first n results |
| `value_counts()` | Frequency Analysis | Counts the frequency of values within a group |

Analyses Performed
- Average release year by content type
- Content count by type
- Rating distribution for Movies and TV Shows
- Top countries by number of titles
- Multiple statistical aggregations (`count`, `mean`, `min`, `max`)

### Key Insights
- TV Shows have a more recent average release year than Movies.
- Netflix's catalog is dominated by Movies.
- TV-MA is the most common rating for both Movies and TV Shows.
- The United States and India contribute the highest number of titles.
- Netflix's catalog is primarily oriented toward an adult audience.
